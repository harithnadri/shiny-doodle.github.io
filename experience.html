            <h3>MSAM volunteer</h3>
            <p><strong>April 2019</strong><br>
                "My volunteer experience at Minggu Saham Amanah Berhad 2019 was truly enriching. 
                It provided me with a unique opportunity to actively participate in promoting financial 
                literacy and investment education among the public. Assisting in organizing workshops, 
                engaging with attendees, and witnessing their eagerness to learn about investment strategies 
                was incredibly rewarding. This experience not only enhanced my communication and teamwork skills 
                but also instilled in me a deep sense of social responsibility. It was a privilege to be part of
                an event dedicated to empowering individuals with financial knowledge, and I am grateful for the 
                valuable lessons and memories from my time as a volunteer."

            <h3>Alim Harmony Part Time Staff</h3>
            <p><strong>November 2018 - March 2019</strong><br>
                "My time as a part-timer at the bookstore was both enjoyable and educational. Working among 
                shelves filled with books of diverse genres allowed me to cultivate a deep appreciation for 
                literature and an understanding of customer preferences. Assisting customers in finding their 
                favorite reads, recommending novels, and organizing book displays were all aspects I cherished. 
                Moreover, it honed my organizational skills and patience in a dynamic retail environment. Being
                 surrounded by book enthusiasts and connecting with fellow readers made this part-time role a memorable 
                 and intellectually stimulating experience."

                "My time as a part-time delivery service provider was a rewarding and fast-paced experience. 
                Being responsible for ensuring timely and accurate deliveries to customers was both challenging and 
                fulfilling. It taught me the importance of punctuality, attention to detail, and effective route planning. 
                Interacting with customers and witnessing their satisfaction upon receiving their packages was a highlight of 
                the role. This experience enhanced my communication skills and problem-solving abilities, and it gave me a 
                deeper appreciation for the logistics and customer service aspects of the delivery industry."
