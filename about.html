        <h1>Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finding the shortest path for Kuliyyah of Engineering (KOE)</h1>
        <p><strong>Objective</strong>: The primary objective of my project is to implement and apply Dijkstra's 
            algorithm to find the shortest path within the context of Kuliyyah of Engineering.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Dijkstra's Algorithm</strong>: Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely used graph traversal and 
            pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. It's particularly 
            useful for solving problems involving networks, routes, or transportation systems.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Application to Kuliyyah of Engineering</strong> I applied Dijkstra's algorithm specifically to the 
            Kuliyyah of Engineering and working with a graph representation of the 
            infrastructure or layout of the Kuliyyah of Engineering, where nodes represent locations or points of 
            interest within the Kuliyyah, and edges represent pathways or connections between these locations

        <h1>Bus Ticket Booking System</h1>
        <p><strong>Objective</strong>: The primary objective of the "Ticket Bus Booking System" project is 
            to develop a user-friendly and efficient software application that enables users to book bus tickets 
            easily and helps bus operators manage their services effectively.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Key Features and Components:</strong><br>
            User Registration and Login: Users, both passengers and bus operators, can create accounts and 
            log in to the system. Secure authentication methods should be implemented.
            <br>
            Ticket Generation: After successful booking and payment, the system should generate electronic 
            tickets with unique identifiers that can be presented to the bus operator.
            <br>
            Route Management: The system should allow bus operators to add, edit, or remove bus routes, 
            update schedules, and set prices.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Challenges and Considerations:</strong> 
            <br>
            Scalability: Consider the potential growth of the system. It should be designed to handle a large number of users and bookings.

        <h1>Pizza Ordering System</h1>
        <p><strong>Objective</strong>: The primary objective of the "Pizza Ordering System" project is to create a user-friendly and 
            efficient software application that allows customers to browse a menu, customize their pizza orders, and place orders for 
            delivery or pickup from a pizzeria.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Key Features and Components:</strong><br>
            User Registration and Login: Users can create accounts or log in to the system to access their order history and save their preferences.
            <br>
            Menu Management: The system should provide a menu with a list of available pizza options, including various sizes, 
            crust types, and toppings. Prices should be displayed for each item
            <br>
            Order Customization: Users can customize their pizza orders by selecting the size, crust type, and toppings they prefer. 
            The system should dynamically update the price based on these selections
            <br><br>
            <strong>Challenges and Considerations:</strong> 
            <br>
            Menu Updates: The system should allow administrators to easily update the menu, add new items, and change prices.
            <br>
            Payment Integration: Integrating with payment gateways requires careful testing and validation to ensure smooth transactions.
